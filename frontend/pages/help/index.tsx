                                Codetierlist to encourage you to start early and to test often. Weâ€™re hoping
                                that being able to compare your code and tests with others will help motivate
                                you to build good tests and will provide some feedback on how effective your
                                testing is.

                                If you are unable to access the tierlist, it is possible that you have not uploaded
                                your code or tests yet. Please ensure that you have uploaded your code and tests
                                before trying to access the tierlist.

                                If you are still unable to access the tierlist, there are a few other reasons
                                that you may be unable to access the tierlist including uploading an incorrect
                                test case. If you are still experiencing issues, please contact your instructor.

                                Codetierlist provides an advantage to students by allowing them to compare their
                                code and tests with others without revealing their identity or committing an
                                academic offense. This allows students to see how their code and tests compare to
                                others and to learn from their peers.
